# Bootstrap 4 Admin Template

A simple Bootstrap 4 admin template that's ready to use right out of the box!. I made this template because I often find myself in need of a simple, pure Bootstrap 4 template. Many of the Admin Dashboard templates I've come across online are over-engineered and overly complex.

Simply **copy &amp; paste** all files in the `/dist` folder into your project.

To view the pages as they are, simply run this command in your console/terminal:
```
npm start
```

And navigate to `http://localhost:3000/index.html` in your web browser.

To update the vendor packages, run this command in your terminal/console:
```
gulp
```
